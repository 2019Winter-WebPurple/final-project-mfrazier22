            <h6>Cove and Dropbox</h6>
            <!-- Paragraph with &nbsp -->
            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ruchi Sanghvi was the VP of Operations at Dropbox. Prior to joining Dropbox, Sanghvi served as the co-founder and CEO of Cove, a collaboration, coordination and communication product for organizations and communities. Dropbox later bought Cove to bring Ruchi and her husband back to work for them. When asking Dropbox co-founder and CEO Drew Huston about the decision to buy Cove to obtain Ruchi Sanghvi, he said “We’ve known Ruchi and Aditya for awhile and have been longtime admirers of their work, there are not too many people that not only think big but have also created things that hundreds of million of people use.” More parts of the interview with Drew Huston about Ruchi Sanghvi can be found <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/27/dropbox-buys-cove-to-bring-former-facebookers-ruchi-sanghvi-and-aditya-agarwal-to-the-team/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
